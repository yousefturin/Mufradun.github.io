    <h1>Privacy Policy for Mufradun</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Mufradun. This Privacy Policy outlines the principles governing the collection, use, and protection of user data within the Mufradun mobile application (referred to herein as the "Service").</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection and Usage:</h2>
        <p>At Mufradun, we prioritize user privacy and transparency. We do not gather any personal information from our users. The Service operates on a model where all data is locally stored on the user's device, ensuring maximum privacy and security.</p>
        <p>The only data we receive from users are their latitude and longitude coordinates. These coordinates are exclusively employed to facilitate location-based functionalities within the application, such as retrieving prayer timings and calculating the direction of the Qibla. It's important to note that these coordinates are neither stored nor transmitted to external servers or third parties.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Mufradun may access external APIs to deliver specific features, such as presenting locally stored data in JSON format and providing prayer timings. Any data procured from external sources remains confined within the application and is not shared or stored beyond its operational scope.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Security Measures:</h2>
        <p>We employ robust security measures to safeguard all data processed within the Mufradun application. User data is stored locally on their respective devices, with stringent protocols in place to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Changes to This Policy:</h2>
        <p>Mufradun reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary to reflect changes in our practices and legal requirements. We encourage users to periodically review this policy for any updates. By continuing to use the Service, users implicitly agree to any revisions made to this policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Contact Us:</h2>
        <p>If you have any inquiries or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy or the practices outlined herein, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Your privacy and satisfaction are paramount to us.</p>
